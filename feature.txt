o.Torvald - Time

Slow down, give me some time
Turn down the volume of your cry
Let's take time to find a place without violence
Let's listen and hear the true meaning of silence

Time to look
Time to see
Time to find

Time to look into your eyes
Time to find truth, time against the lies
Time will give us a sign
It can make a promise, it's our time to shine
